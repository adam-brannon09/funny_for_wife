		<p id="love-note" style="display: none;">Hey love, I just wanted to tell you that I hope you have a great day at work today and that we truly appreciate everything you do. Putting up with the three of us is enough to make anyone insane, I honestly have no idea how you do it. If you're ever having a rough time at work I hope you will always remember that you are loved, valued, and cherished more than anyone on this planet. We've missed you this week and look forward to spending every second with you this weekend. Thank you for being everything we need, even when it means being everything we don't deserve. We love you! - Hubbs, Ainsley, and Jaxson  </p>
